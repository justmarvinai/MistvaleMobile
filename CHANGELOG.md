## [Unreleased]

### Added — Phase P2: The game becomes playable

A fresh account can now pick a starter, walk into chapter 1-1 and fight it, and come out with silver and XP. Everything below the client is in place; the battle screen is next.

- **Roster** — `player_champions` holds owned champions as *instances* (level, rank, ascension, XP, lock, favourite) that reference a champion definition rather than copying its stats, so a balance publish reaches every copy at once. Roster capacity is enforced in one place, so summoning, quest rewards and the tutorial grant cannot get it subtly different.
- **Starters** — `GET /api/player/starters` lists whatever content flags `starter`, and `POST /api/player/starter` grants the chosen one. Adding or changing a starter is an Admin edit. The grant is idempotent: a retried tutorial step cannot mint a second roster.
- **Battles** — start, act, auto-resolve, retreat, resume. `battle_sessions` stores the engine's whole state as JSONB, so a fight survives a server restart and resumes on exactly the turn it paused at. A unique partial index enforces one active battle per player, which is what stops a second start from stranding the first one's energy.
- **Idempotency** — every action carries a client-generated `actionId`; replaying one returns the recorded state instead of taking another turn, and cannot pay out twice. That makes a dropped response safe on a phone.
- **RewardService** — the one path resources move by. It enforces the floors, rolls a stage's silver from the battle's own seed (so a replay reports the same loot), and writes every movement to `economy_log`. A route touching a wallet column directly is a bug.
- **Stars** — one for the win, one for finishing inside the turn limit, one for finishing with everyone alive.
- **Tests** — 18 integration cases against the real seeded content and a real database: the starter flow, energy spend, the one-battle-at-a-time guard, a full auto-resolved fight paying out exactly once, retry safety, manual play, retreat, and the check that another player cannot read your battle.

### Added — Phase P2: Battle engine

The fight itself. `packages/engine` is a pure, deterministic simulation: give it content and a seed and it returns state plus an event log, which is the only thing the client ever renders from.

- **Turn meter** — SPD × 0.07 per tick, solved analytically rather than looped, with the documented tie-breaks (highest meter, then the priority side, then the lower slot) and overflow carried so speed compounds. `projectTurnOrder` re-derives the same order for the turn-order strip, so what a player sees is what happens.
- **Damage** — the element wheel with roll-based STRONG/WEAK hits, crit (weak hits never crit; advantage lends crit chance), `K/(K+DEF)` mitigation, ignore-DEF, Weaken/Strengthen, and a configurable spread. Roll order is normative and pinned by tests.
- **Accuracy versus resistance** — the ~90%-parity curve, capped above and floored below, with "cannot be resisted" and the Arena's anti-perma-stun rule.
- **All fifteen status behaviours** — stat modifiers, damage and heal over time, shields, the three turn-skips, Provoke, buff and debuff blocks, counterattack, ally protection, reflect, lifesteal both ways, heal reduction and unkillable. Families make a stronger member replace a weaker one and an equal one refresh it; Poison is the one stacking family; durations tick at the end of the holder's turn.
- **Skills as data** — all nine effect components execute from the published DSL, with per-component conditions, chance and targeting. Adding a skill needs no code.
- **Waves** — both effect bars clear, cooldowns tick, survivors heal, meters reset; HP and deaths persist.
- **AI** — deterministic and hint-driven, shared by enemies and auto-battle, with manual play overriding it.
- **Tests** — 132 engine cases: per-mechanic units, property tests over 60 randomised battles (termination, HP bounds, one death event per casualty), and two committed golden replays that make any behaviour change deliberate.
- **`tools/balance-sim`** — batch simulation over the shipped seeds with the tuning gates from COMBAT_SYSTEM §14, wired into CI. Deterministic: 2,000 fixed seeds per scenario, so the measurement is reproducible rather than flaky.

### Fixed — found by the balance simulator
- Enemy stats were scaled from level 1 while the seeds authored them at a reference level, so chapter 1-1 fought level-60-scale lizards: a fresh account lost 100% of the time. Enemies now carry an explicit `anchorLevel` (default 60, editable in Admin) and scale by `growth ^ (level − anchorLevel)`, the same convention champions already used.
- Anuria cleared chapter 1 on auto only 84% of the time against a 95% target. Twinshot moved from ×0.95 to ×1.1 per arrow — the top of the documented A1 band — which is the pressure her archer identity promises.
- Manual play paused for an action *before* checking whether the unit could act, so a stunned champion would have left the client showing a skill bar it could not use. A turn now opens (meter spent, damage-over-time resolved, crowd control checked) before the battle waits on anyone.
- Prettier reformatted the committed golden replays after the generator wrote them, so they could never match a fresh generation — the same failure mode as the OpenAPI artifact, now fixed the same way.

### Added — Phase P1: Content backbone

Content becomes data. Champions, skills, enemies, stages and every balance constant now live in the database, are edited through the Admin Suite, and reach players on publish — without a deploy.

- **Content contracts** (`packages/shared/src/content/`) — the effect-component DSL every skill is assembled from (damage, applyStatus, heal, shield, turnMeter, cleanse, dispel, extraTurn, cooldown, with conditions and targeting), Zod schemas for all twelve content families, and a type registry the CRUD routes, validation, seeds and client bundle all iterate rather than hard-code.
- **Storage** — `content_entries` holds a live and a draft state per entity; `content_revisions` keeps a full snapshot per publish, which is what makes one-click revert possible.
- **ContentCache** — live content is loaded once into an immutable snapshot and served from memory; publishing swaps the whole snapshot atomically, so no request can ever see half the old content and half the new.
- **Validation in three layers** — schema, then cross-references (a champion cannot go live naming a skill that does not exist), then the engine registry (no status or effect that no code implements). Errors block a publish; warnings do not.
- **Admin API** — draft-only writes for every content type, validate, a field-level diff with risk flags on rate/balance/economy changes, publish with a note, revert, revision history, and discard. Every mutation is audited; the whole surface requires the `admin` rank.
- **Content delivery** — public `GET /api/content` serving the pre-serialised bundle with ETag/304, and a client store that caches it in IndexedDB keyed by revision and re-fetches when a publish moves it.
- **Published API contract** — every Admin endpoint and the public content bundle are described once in Zod and generated into `docs/openapi/admin-api.json` (`pnpm openapi`). The Admin Suite generates its client types from that artifact instead of hand-mirroring DTOs, CI fails when the committed artifact drifts from the schemas, and a contract test calls each endpoint for real and parses the response with the schema the document was generated from — so the document cannot describe an API the server does not serve.
- **Seeds** — 36 status effects, 8 factions, the relic system (9 slots, 16 sets), 17 items, the full **37-champion roster + 6 food units** (the seven showcase kits transcribed from the design doc, the other thirty built from the §1b kit-hook table on the placeholder model), 136 skills, the Sskarn enemy roster with chapter 1's boss, chapter 1 across three difficulties, and every tunable constant from the economy and combat docs — 338 entities, validated in CI.

### Added — Phase P0: Foundation

First working code. A visitor can create an account, sign in, and reach the Haven; the shell, database, and deployment path around that are production-shaped rather than sketched.

- **Monorepo & tooling** — pnpm workspace (`apps/client`, `apps/server`, `packages/shared`, `packages/engine`, `tools/*`), TypeScript strict throughout, ESLint 9 flat config (with React hooks rules), Prettier, Vitest, Playwright. `pnpm verify` runs the same gate as CI.
- **CI** (GitHub Actions) — format → lint → typecheck → migrate → test → build, plus a committed-migration drift check, and a second job running the browser end-to-end suite. Tests run against a real PostgreSQL 16 service, never a mock.
- **Database** — Drizzle schema and first migration for `accounts`, `sessions`, `players`, `audit_log`, `economy_log`, including the Player/GameMaster/Admin rank model, case-insensitive unique account and profile names (`citext`), and CHECK constraints on enums, level and currency ranges.
- **Server** — Fastify 5 with validated environment config, pino logging (credential redaction, sampled success logs), the `{ok,data|error,rev}` envelope with a closed error-code set, per-route rate limiting, request ids echoed on every response, and rank-gated health endpoints. Scheduled maintenance runs in-process.
- **Authentication** — register, login, logout, logout-everywhere, session probe, and change-password. argon2id hashing tuned for the target VPS, session tokens stored only as peppered hashes, httpOnly cookie with a Bearer fallback, sliding expiry, and constant-time behaviour so an unknown account is indistinguishable from a wrong password.
- **Engine foundation** — seeded xoshiro128** RNG with state snapshots and derived streams, the determinism the battle simulation will be built on in P2.
- **Client shell** — React 18 + Vite + PixiJS v8. Hand-built pixel UI kit (Button, Panel, TextField, Modal with focus trap, Toasts), design tokens, the persistent Pixi stage with an animated mist backdrop, screen registry with level-gated destinations shown as mist-shrouded teasers, the Haven, resource top bar with locally-animated energy, dock with keyboard shortcuts, and settings (audio, reduced motion, colour-blind glyphs, battle speed, password change).
- **Tools** — `tools/icon-fetch` fetches, normalises and attributes 79 game-icons.net icons into a sprite sheet (`pnpm icons`).
- **Operations** — `DEPLOY.sh`, `UPDATE.sh` (with automatic rollback), `BACKUP.sh`, `RESTORE.sh`, `STATUS.sh`, `LOGS.sh`, `SEED.sh`, `SET_RANK.sh`, plus nginx, systemd and PostgreSQL configs for `play.pathlands.cc` with the Admin Panel under `/admin`.

### Changed
- Zod upgraded 3 → 4, matching the stack decision the docs already recorded. `z.toJSONSchema` is what generates the OpenAPI artifact, so the contract needs no extra dependency.

### Fixed
- The committed OpenAPI artifact could never match a fresh generation: Prettier reformatted `docs/openapi/admin-api.json` after `pnpm openapi` wrote it, so `pnpm openapi:check` failed on a file nobody had edited. The generator owns that file's formatting now.
- `UPDATE.sh` only seeded on a fresh install, so a release that introduces a new content family migrated the tables in and then left them empty — no champions in game and nothing to edit in Admin. It now runs `SEED.sh` on every update; that mode fills only empty tables and never touches authored content, which is what the script was already documented to do. Replacing live content still requires an explicit `--force-content`.
- `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md` §3 listed Vale Sentinels as "Anuria + 4"; the roster in `CONTENT_PLAN_EA01.md` §1b has five more, and the seeded faction counts agree with §1b.
- Seeded content and Admin-published content were stored in different shapes: the Admin write path persisted the parsed entity (schema defaults filled in) while the seed persisted the file as written, so a hand-authored skill could reach the database without the `hits` an Admin-authored one carried. Validation now normalises once at the persistence boundary and both paths store the parsed result, so how content was authored can never change what the engine reads. Input-shaped `…DefInput` types make the distinction explicit for authors.
- Rate-limited requests returned a 500 "Something went wrong on our end" instead of a 429: the custom response builder returned a plain object that Fastify treated as an unhandled error. Formatting now happens once, in the global error handler. Caught by the end-to-end run; pinned by a regression test.

### Changed
- **Planning updated after owner review (all USER_QUESTIONS answered):** Anuria reworked to archer/ranger (kit + ranged battle visuals) · EA roster expanded from 7 to **37 champions + 6 food units** — 30 new champions across all 8 factions and rarities up to Legendary using the territorial-lizard placeholder model until real art arrives via Admin (Broodling food economy approved; Mistbound-Cache workaround removed; missions finale now awards exclusive Legendary **Aureleth, Voice of the Vale**) · account model switched to **ranks (Player / GameMaster / Admin)** on one account system — Admin Panel at `play.pathlands.cc/admin`, admin-rank-only, first admin bootstrapped by DEPLOY.sh/SET_RANK.sh · deployment locked to single domain `play.pathlands.cc` with path-based routing, bare-metal · all eight suggested QoL additions approved and scheduled (choice tomes, multi-battle, replays + share links, Odds & Mercy, team presets, first-win bonuses, practice sandbox, colorblind glyphs) · new binding design rule **GDD §1.1 "Depth budget"**: RSL-scale grind & content with reduced entry complexity.
