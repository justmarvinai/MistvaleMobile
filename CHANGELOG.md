## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- **Planning updated after owner review (all USER_QUESTIONS answered):** Anuria reworked to archer/ranger (kit + ranged battle visuals) · EA roster expanded from 7 to **37 champions + 6 food units** — 30 new champions across all 8 factions and rarities up to Legendary using the territorial-lizard placeholder model until real art arrives via Admin (Broodling food economy approved; Mistbound-Cache workaround removed; missions finale now awards exclusive Legendary **Aureleth, Voice of the Vale**) · account model switched to **ranks (Player / GameMaster / Admin)** on one account system — Admin Panel at `play.pathlands.cc/admin`, admin-rank-only, first admin bootstrapped by DEPLOY.sh/SET_RANK.sh · deployment locked to single domain `play.pathlands.cc` with path-based routing, bare-metal · all eight suggested QoL additions approved and scheduled (choice tomes, multi-battle, replays + share links, Odds & Mercy, team presets, first-win bonuses, practice sandbox, colorblind glyphs) · new binding design rule **GDD §1.1 "Depth budget"**: RSL-scale grind & content with reduced entry complexity.
