## [Unreleased]

### Added — Phase P1: Content backbone

Content becomes data. Champions, skills, enemies, stages and every balance constant now live in the database, are edited through the Admin Suite, and reach players on publish — without a deploy.

- **Content contracts** (`packages/shared/src/content/`) — the effect-component DSL every skill is assembled from (damage, applyStatus, heal, shield, turnMeter, cleanse, dispel, extraTurn, cooldown, with conditions and targeting), Zod schemas for all twelve content families, and a type registry the CRUD routes, validation, seeds and client bundle all iterate rather than hard-code.
- **Storage** — `content_entries` holds a live and a draft state per entity; `content_revisions` keeps a full snapshot per publish, which is what makes one-click revert possible.
- **ContentCache** — live content is loaded once into an immutable snapshot and served from memory; publishing swaps the whole snapshot atomically, so no request can ever see half the old content and half the new.
- **Validation in three layers** — schema, then cross-references (a champion cannot go live naming a skill that does not exist), then the engine registry (no status or effect that no code implements). Errors block a publish; warnings do not.
- **Admin API** — draft-only writes for every content type, validate, a field-level diff with risk flags on rate/balance/economy changes, publish with a note, revert, revision history, and discard. Every mutation is audited; the whole surface requires the `admin` rank.
- **Content delivery** — public `GET /api/content` serving the pre-serialised bundle with ETag/304, and a client store that caches it in IndexedDB keyed by revision and re-fetches when a publish moves it.
- **Published API contract** — every Admin endpoint and the public content bundle are described once in Zod and generated into `docs/openapi/admin-api.json` (`pnpm openapi`). The Admin Suite generates its client types from that artifact instead of hand-mirroring DTOs, CI fails when the committed artifact drifts from the schemas, and a contract test calls each endpoint for real and parses the response with the schema the document was generated from — so the document cannot describe an API the server does not serve.
- **Seeds** — 36 status effects, 8 factions, the relic system (9 slots, 16 sets), 17 items, the full **37-champion roster + 6 food units** (the seven showcase kits transcribed from the design doc, the other thirty built from the §1b kit-hook table on the placeholder model), 136 skills, the Sskarn enemy roster with chapter 1's boss, chapter 1 across three difficulties, and every tunable constant from the economy and combat docs — 338 entities, validated in CI.

### Added — Phase P0: Foundation

First working code. A visitor can create an account, sign in, and reach the Haven; the shell, database, and deployment path around that are production-shaped rather than sketched.

- **Monorepo & tooling** — pnpm workspace (`apps/client`, `apps/server`, `packages/shared`, `packages/engine`, `tools/*`), TypeScript strict throughout, ESLint 9 flat config (with React hooks rules), Prettier, Vitest, Playwright. `pnpm verify` runs the same gate as CI.
- **CI** (GitHub Actions) — format → lint → typecheck → migrate → test → build, plus a committed-migration drift check, and a second job running the browser end-to-end suite. Tests run against a real PostgreSQL 16 service, never a mock.
- **Database** — Drizzle schema and first migration for `accounts`, `sessions`, `players`, `audit_log`, `economy_log`, including the Player/GameMaster/Admin rank model, case-insensitive unique account and profile names (`citext`), and CHECK constraints on enums, level and currency ranges.
- **Server** — Fastify 5 with validated environment config, pino logging (credential redaction, sampled success logs), the `{ok,data|error,rev}` envelope with a closed error-code set, per-route rate limiting, request ids echoed on every response, and rank-gated health endpoints. Scheduled maintenance runs in-process.
- **Authentication** — register, login, logout, logout-everywhere, session probe, and change-password. argon2id hashing tuned for the target VPS, session tokens stored only as peppered hashes, httpOnly cookie with a Bearer fallback, sliding expiry, and constant-time behaviour so an unknown account is indistinguishable from a wrong password.
- **Engine foundation** — seeded xoshiro128** RNG with state snapshots and derived streams, the determinism the battle simulation will be built on in P2.
- **Client shell** — React 18 + Vite + PixiJS v8. Hand-built pixel UI kit (Button, Panel, TextField, Modal with focus trap, Toasts), design tokens, the persistent Pixi stage with an animated mist backdrop, screen registry with level-gated destinations shown as mist-shrouded teasers, the Haven, resource top bar with locally-animated energy, dock with keyboard shortcuts, and settings (audio, reduced motion, colour-blind glyphs, battle speed, password change).
- **Tools** — `tools/icon-fetch` fetches, normalises and attributes 79 game-icons.net icons into a sprite sheet (`pnpm icons`).
- **Operations** — `DEPLOY.sh`, `UPDATE.sh` (with automatic rollback), `BACKUP.sh`, `RESTORE.sh`, `STATUS.sh`, `LOGS.sh`, `SEED.sh`, `SET_RANK.sh`, plus nginx, systemd and PostgreSQL configs for `play.pathlands.cc` with the Admin Panel under `/admin`.

### Changed
- Zod upgraded 3 → 4, matching the stack decision the docs already recorded. `z.toJSONSchema` is what generates the OpenAPI artifact, so the contract needs no extra dependency.

### Fixed
- `UPDATE.sh` only seeded on a fresh install, so a release that introduces a new content family migrated the tables in and then left them empty — no champions in game and nothing to edit in Admin. It now runs `SEED.sh` on every update; that mode fills only empty tables and never touches authored content, which is what the script was already documented to do. Replacing live content still requires an explicit `--force-content`.
- `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md` §3 listed Vale Sentinels as "Anuria + 4"; the roster in `CONTENT_PLAN_EA01.md` §1b has five more, and the seeded faction counts agree with §1b.
- Seeded content and Admin-published content were stored in different shapes: the Admin write path persisted the parsed entity (schema defaults filled in) while the seed persisted the file as written, so a hand-authored skill could reach the database without the `hits` an Admin-authored one carried. Validation now normalises once at the persistence boundary and both paths store the parsed result, so how content was authored can never change what the engine reads. Input-shaped `…DefInput` types make the distinction explicit for authors.
- Rate-limited requests returned a 500 "Something went wrong on our end" instead of a 429: the custom response builder returned a plain object that Fastify treated as an unhandled error. Formatting now happens once, in the global error handler. Caught by the end-to-end run; pinned by a regression test.

### Changed
- **Planning updated after owner review (all USER_QUESTIONS answered):** Anuria reworked to archer/ranger (kit + ranged battle visuals) · EA roster expanded from 7 to **37 champions + 6 food units** — 30 new champions across all 8 factions and rarities up to Legendary using the territorial-lizard placeholder model until real art arrives via Admin (Broodling food economy approved; Mistbound-Cache workaround removed; missions finale now awards exclusive Legendary **Aureleth, Voice of the Vale**) · account model switched to **ranks (Player / GameMaster / Admin)** on one account system — Admin Panel at `play.pathlands.cc/admin`, admin-rank-only, first admin bootstrapped by DEPLOY.sh/SET_RANK.sh · deployment locked to single domain `play.pathlands.cc` with path-based routing, bare-metal · all eight suggested QoL additions approved and scheduled (choice tomes, multi-battle, replays + share links, Odds & Mercy, team presets, first-win bonuses, practice sandbox, colorblind glyphs) · new binding design rule **GDD §1.1 "Depth budget"**: RSL-scale grind & content with reduced entry complexity.
